# Serde Validate

This repository contains two Rust crates for validating deserialized structs and enums:
- `serde-validate`
- `serde-validate-macro`

## Overview

The `serde-validate` crate provides utilities for validating deserialized structs and enums in Rust. It includes a `Validate` trait and a procedural macro, `validate_deser`, that generates deserialization code with integrated validation.

The `serde-validate-macro` crate provides the procedural macro implementation used by `serde-validate`.
